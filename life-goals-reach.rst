Reach goals in life
===================
When you are overwhelmed with work, you might schedule too much in one day, in the wishful hope that you will magically get it all done.  This is a false and unfair promise.  It is not how much you get done, but whether you are doing what is essential toward a long-term goal.

Choose
------
If I can reach only one goal today, which one will take me closest to where I want to be?  

Walk
----
Write one goal and do it.  By choosing your course of action one at a time, you can decide what to do next using the most current information.

Sprint
------
Concentrate on your task and do not allow yourself to be distracted for ten minutes.  Then take a rest.

Prune
-----
- Is it necessary?  What if I never complete this goal?
- Is it sufficient?  What if this is the only goal I will complete today?
- Is it reasonable?  Can I complete the goal in a few hours?

Plan
----
Don't worry about choosing goals that are modest.  Pick something you can finish.  Involve other people to stay on track.
