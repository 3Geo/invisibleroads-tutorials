Reach life goals
================
When overwhelmed with work, you might schedule too much in one day in the wishful hope that you will magically get it all done.  This is a false and unfair promise.  It is not how much you get done, but whether you are doing what is essential toward a long-term goal.


Choose
------
If I can reach only one goal today, which one will take me closest to where I want to be?  


Mark
----
Mark selected tasks as crucial to your mission.  Finish crucial tasks first.


Talk
----
Find or create a `coworking space <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coworking>`_ where you can talk and work next to like-minded individuals.


Walk
----
Write one task and do it.  By choosing your action one at a time, you can decide what to do next using the most current information.


Sprint
------
Start a timer with an alarm for ten minutes, then work against the clock.  It really works!
