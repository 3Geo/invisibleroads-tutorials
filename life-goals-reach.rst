Reach life goals
================
When you are overwhelmed with work, you might schedule too much in one day, in the wishful hope that you will magically get it all done.  This is a false and unfair promise.  It is not how much you get done, but whether you are doing what is essential toward a long-term goal.


Choose
------
If I can reach only one goal today, which one will take me closest to where I want to be?  


Walk
----
Write one goal and do it.  By choosing your course of action one at a time, you can decide what to do next using the most current information.


Sprint
------
Concentrate on your task and do not allow yourself to be distracted for ten minutes.


Plan
----
Don't worry about choosing goals that are modest.  Pick something you can finish concretely.  Involve other people to stay on track.


Assess
------
Assign points to each goal to give yourself an idea of which goals are more important.


Reward
------
Make a list of reward goals underneath your list of task goals.  This is more flexible than assigning rewards to tasks directly.
