Reach life goals
================
When overwhelmed with work, I might schedule too much in one day in the wishful hope that I will magically get it all done.  This is a false and unfair promise.  It is not how much you get done, but whether you are doing what is essential toward a long-term goal.


Choose
------
If I can reach only one goal today, which one will take me closest to where I want to be?  


Rank
----
Suppose I accomplish A but not B, how would I feel?  Rank goals in advance to make decisions quickly.


Mark
----
Mark selected tasks as crucial to my mission.  Finish crucial tasks first.


Talk
----
Talk and work next to people with similar interests to boost morale.


Walk
----
Write one task and do it.  By choosing my action one at a time, I can decide what to do next using the most current information.


Sprint
------
Start a timer with an alarm for ten minutes, then work against the clock.  It really works!
