Tango
=====
- Directions are from a bird's eye point of view, so that if a woman turns to her right, she is turning clockwise.
- The walk is the most important part of the dance.
- Man moves his torso a split-second ahead of his legs to signal intent.
- Dancers maintain support grounded in one leg while keeping the torso elevated.
- Before moving, the dancers slowly shift weight from side to side to negotiate which foot is grounded.
