Collaborate with engineers
==========================
Beware of making mistakes that handicap the engineer.

* Asking the engineer to implement what you think is the solution without explaining the problem will result in a product that does not address the real problem.
* Simplifying your description of the problem in a way that you think the engineer will understand will result in the engineered solution failing under real use.
* Dictating your solution based on what you think is not possible on a computer will result in a product that is uninspired and outdated.

An understanding of the real-world problem and the freedom to implement the solution empower the engineer to apply his or her technical expertise creatively and passionately.

* Explain the motivation and purpose.
* Describe the problem with as much real-world complexity as is relevant.
* Let the engineer figure out what is possible.
