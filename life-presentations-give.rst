Give presentations
==================

Make sure your audience is following what you are saying.  Beware of jumping from topic to topic too quickly.

Make sure your audience knows what you are referring to or pointing at.  Beware of pointing vaguely and saying this/that/it without actually specifying what the things are.

Make sure your audience can hear what you are saying.  Beware of mumbling parts of your sentences.
