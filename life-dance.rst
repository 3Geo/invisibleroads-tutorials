Dance
=====
Having fun is more important than doing a lot of moves.

Directions are from a bird's eye point of view, so that if a woman turns to her right, she is turning clockwise.


Salsa
-----
- Listen for the downbeat.  In the basic step, the man uses his left leg to step forward and his right leg to step backward.  For NY style on 2 timing with a partner, the man steps with his left foot back on the downbeat, steps his right foot further back, steps his left foot in place, pauses, steps his right foot forward, steps his left foot further forward, steps his right foot in place, pauses.  For LA style on 1 timing with a partner, the man steps with his left foot forward on the downbeat, steps his right foot in place, returns his left foot to standing position, pauses, steps his right foot back, steps his left foot in place, return his right foot to standing position, pauses.
- Shift weight onto the moving foot.
- Shift weight even when not moving, to stay in beat.
- Keep your eyes focused on your partner.
- Stagger feet with your partner for a close embrace.
- If the woman and man turn or spin at the same time, the man signals the woman to spin or turn first, then the man spins or turns but must finish before she does so that he can signal the next lead.
